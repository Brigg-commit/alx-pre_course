Create a new directory called 0x01-git in your alx-pre_course repo.

Make sure you include a non empty README.md in your directory:

at the root of your repository alx-pre_course
AND in the directory 0x01-git
And important part: Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.
